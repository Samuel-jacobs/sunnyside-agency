- HTML5
- CSS3
- BOOTSRAP 4


### What I learned

during the course of working on this project, i learned a few things and reinforced my knowledge on other things.

One thing i learned was how to use images with different sizes on different screen sizes. This makes it easier for users
when loading pages on their browsers asthe browser selects the appropraite image that suits whatever screen size in use.

 This was done by using the following syntax
 ```html 
<picture>
<source media="(max/min-width: xpx)" srcset="image.jpg">
</picture>
```
the <picture> elements gives more flexibility in specifying image resources 
 
the media element defines the screen size at which a particular image is used
 
the srcset defines the image file path, it is used when you need to include more than one image 


### Continued development

I intend to work more on using css flexbox and grid for responsive design in my subsequent projects

### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images)
  This article helped me understand how use different image sizes for different screen size. I think it might be helpful
  for anyone still trying to understand the concept
- [resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me when I got stuck trying to remember a syntax or a css style.
